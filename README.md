# NewBee White Paper



Keynote and issues of reading paper about database, distributed system, storage system.

Usually, I post my keynote on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Zrealshadow). However, gist does not provide index function.

Thus I take the issue of github repository as an search engine for my keynote. 



**Have fun in the journal of system !**
